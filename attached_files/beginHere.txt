This txt file contains two paragraphs of ciphertext, each encrypted using different ciphers. The first ciphertext paragraph is encrypted using the Playfair cipher. You may google and/or wikipedia what this cipher is and how it works, but it is basically a type of substitution cipher. You may make use of the playfair_go_and_do_yourself.py code to help you decrypt the ciphertext, or you can also solve the ciphertext by hand. Decrypting this ciphertext will reveal the answer to the riddle (key 1) and will also give you a hint on what to do with the decrypted image to obtain key 2. As for the second ciphertext, it is encrypted with Vigenere. You can obtain the key for it by decrypting the image.
